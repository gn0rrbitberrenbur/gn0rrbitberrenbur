##About me
My name is Chris and I enjoy everything about computers and learning new things.

###Why am I here?
I am trying to write code that I and hopefully other people benefit of. I am a big advocate of the OpenSource-Movement.

####What do I like?
As I mentioned already I love computers. In the time that I am actually away from them I like to do all sorts of sports with my feet, cook, read and photograph.

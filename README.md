## About me👨‍💻
My name is Chris and I enjoy everything about computers and learning new things.

## Why am I here?📖
I am trying to write code that I and hopefully other people benefit of.

## What do I like?🦾
As I mentioned already I love computers. In the time that I am actually away from them I like to do all sorts of sports, cook, read and photograph.

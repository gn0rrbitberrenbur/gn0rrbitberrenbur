👋 hi, I'm gnorrbitberrenbur, but you can call me Chris <br>
I'm a trainee from germany, and I am interested in STEM, programming, data science and hiking. <br>
here on github I mostly host my personal projects, that I somehow open source. so of you find anything useful, feel free to fork.

where is your github name from?
> it's coming straight from an dnd name generator. when I created this github, this was the first name that came to my mind.
